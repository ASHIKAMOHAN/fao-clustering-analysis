# FAO Data Clustering and Pattern Analysis

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyse datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The objective is to uncover hidden patterns, group similarities, and structural trends within agricultural and food-related data.

## Motivation
Understanding global agricultural patterns is essential for policy-making, sustainability planning, and economic analysis. Clustering techniques help reveal relationships that are not immediately visible through traditional analysis.

## Data
- Source: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
- Format: Structured tabular data
- Scope: Agricultural and food-related indicators across regions and time

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Unsupervised learning techniques:
  - K-Means clustering
  - Curve fitting / trend analysis
- Cluster evaluation and interpretation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Identification of distinct agricultural patterns
- Grouping of regions based on similar indicators
- Visual interpretation of clusters

## Limitations
- Sensitivity to feature scaling
- Cluster interpretability depends on variable selection

## Future Work
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Advanced clustering methods (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Time-evolving cluster analysis
